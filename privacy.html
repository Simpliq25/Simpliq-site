        <p>At <strong>Simpliq</strong>, we value your privacy and we have zero interest in selling your data to telemarketers or shady third parties. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

        <h2>1. The Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We only collect what is absolutely necessary to run this huddle:</p>
        <p><strong>Contact Info:</strong> Your name and email address.<br>
        <strong>Payment Info:</strong> Your credit card details are handled entirely by Stripe. We never see your full card number and we don't store it on our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We use your information for two things and two things only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To send you the newsletters you paid for.</li>
            <li>To manage your subscription (billing, renewals, and "Mutual Breakups").</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Who We Share It With (The Short List)</h2>
        <p>We don't "sell" your data. We only share it with the tools required to actually run Simpliq:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> To process your payments securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> To handle our communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Rights (The Legal Stuff)</h2>
        <p>Whether you are in California (CCPA), the EU (GDPR), or anywhere else, we believe you own your data. You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>See it:</strong> Ask us what info we have on you.</li>
            <li><strong>Fix it:</strong> Update your email or name.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete it:</strong> Request that we wipe your data from our system.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop it:</strong> Every email has an "Unsubscribe" link. Use it, and we’ll stop bothering you immediately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
        <p>Our website uses basic cookies to make sure the "Join" button works and you stay logged in. We aren't following you around the internet like a digital stalker.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption and security measures. Since we use Proton and Stripe, your most sensitive data is tucked away behind some of the best digital vaults in the world.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we change how we handle your data, we’ll update this page and let you know in a Tuesday Drop. We won't sneak anything past you.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about your data—or if you think the math is wrong—you can reach the humans at:</p>
