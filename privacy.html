    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="color: #007bff;">Privacy Policy</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-style: italic; opacity: 0.9;">
      At Simpliq, we value your privacy and we have zero interest in selling your data to telemarketers or shady third parties. This policy explains how we handle your information.
    </p>

    <div style="border-left: 3px solid #1abc9c; padding-left: 20px;">
      <p><strong>1. The Information We Collect</strong><br>
      We only collect what is absolutely necessary to run this huddle: <strong>Contact Info</strong> (Your name and email address) and <strong>Payment Info</strong> (Your credit card details are handled entirely by Stripe; we never see your full card number and we don't store it on our servers).</p>

      <p><strong>2. How We Use Your Data</strong><br>
      We use your information for two things and two things only: To send you the newsletters you paid for, and to manage your subscription (billing, renewals, and "Mutual Breakups").</p>

      <p><strong>3. Who We Share It With</strong><br>
      We don't "sell" your data. We only share it with the tools required to actually run Simpliq: Stripe (to process your payments securely) and Email (to handle our communications).</p>

      <p><strong>4. Your Rights</strong><br>
      Whether you are in California (CCPA), the EU (GDPR), or anywhere else, you own your data. You have the right to see it, fix it, or delete it.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Cookies & Security</strong><br>
      Our website uses basic cookies to make sure the "Join" button works. We use industry-standard encryption and security measures. Since we use Stripe and secure email, your sensitive data is tucked away in some of the best digital vaults in the world.</p>
