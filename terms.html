  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

  <p>
    Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal. Returns are not guaranteed, may fluctuate, and can be negative. 
    Modelled or reported results do not reflect actual trading and do not account for transaction costs, slippage, or taxes; 
    no investor is guaranteed to achieve the same gains or losses, and past performance is not indicative of future results.
  </p>

  <p>
    This material is for educational and informational purposes only and is not legal, tax, securities, or investment advice, 
    a recommendation on the suitability of any investment, or a solicitation. Users should conduct their own due diligence and consult 
    qualified legal, tax, or financial professionals for guidance tailored to their situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simpliq, its owners, employees, and independent contractors are not registered as a broker‑dealer, investment adviser, 
    or a representative with any securities regulatory authority or organization. All statements are based on information that is
